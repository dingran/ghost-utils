# FAQ

## How to set it up?

It's very simple:

1. You provided your **Ghost Admin API and URL**, so that Ghost Preview can access your content
2. You put **one line code injection** in your Ghost site, it looks like this `<script src="https://ghutils.dingran.me/static/ghpreview.js" data-site="SITE-ID" defer></script>`

<HStack>
  <div> That's it! Get started now ðŸ‘‰ </div>
  <LoginButtons />
</HStack>

You can read detailed setup instructions [**here**](https://www.dingran.me/ghost-preview-setup/)

## How does it work behind the scene?

Also very simple:

1. We use the Ghost Admin API to access your posts that are not publicly visible (i.e. paid and member-only posts), and create preview (a trucated version of it) for each of them.
2. The code injection you added to your site allows the browser to retrieve these previews and intert them into the right place for the readers to view.

You can control how much preview to offer, in terms of length percentage, the defeault is 40%.

## Why is it free?

It was simple to build and free to host, so it's free for fair use.
